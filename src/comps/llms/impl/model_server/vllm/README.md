# vLLM LLM Model Server

This document focuses on using the [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) as a LLM.

vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving, it delivers state-of-the-art serving throughput with a set of advanced features such as PagedAttention, Continuous batching and etc. Besides GPUs, vLLM already supported [Intel CPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/overview.html). This guide provides an example on how to launch vLLM serving endpoint on CPU.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite
Provide your Hugging Face API key to enable access to Hugging Face models. Alternatively, you can set this in the dotenv configuration files.
```bash
export HF_TOKEN=${your_hf_api_token}
```

Also, create a folder to preserve model data on host and change the ownership to the id that would match user in the image:
```bash
mkdir -p docker/data/
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./docker/data
```

### 🚀 Start the vLLM Service via script (Option 1)
#### Run the script

```bash
chmod +x run_vllm.sh
./run_vllm.sh
```
The script initiates a Docker container with the vLLM model server running on port `LLM_VLLM_PORT` (default: **8008**). Configuration settings are specified in the environment configuration file [docker/cpu/.env](docker/cpu/.env). You can adjust these settings by modifying the appropriate dotenv file or by exporting environment variables.

#### Verify the vLLM Service

First, check the logs to confirm the service is operational:
```bash
docker logs -f llm-vllm-model-server
```

The following log messages indicate that the startup of model server is completed:
```bash

INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:80 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### 🚀 Deploy vLLM Service with LLM Microservice using Docker Compose (Option 2)

To launch vLLM Service along with the LLM Microservice, follow these steps:

#### Modify the environment configuration file to align it to your case

Modify the `./docker/cpu/.env` file:

```env
#HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-api-key>

## VLLM Model Server Settings ##
LLM_VLLM_MODEL_NAME="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
LLM_VLLM_PORT=8008

## VLLM Settings ##
VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE=10
VLLM_DTYPE=bfloat16
VLLM_MAX_NUM_SEQS=256
VLLM_SKIP_WARMUP=false

[...]
```

#### Start the Services using Docker Compose

To build and start the services using Docker Compose

```bash
# for CPU device
cd docker/cpu
mkdir -p data
export UID && docker compose --env-file=.env -f docker-compose.yaml up --build -d


```

Note: Due to secure container best practices, main process is started as non-privileged user.
Due to the fact it uses volume mounts, the volume directory `data/` must be created beforehand.

#### Service Cleanup

To cleanup the services using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd docker

docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
```

### Verify the Services

- Test the `llm-vllm-model-server` using the following command:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8008/v1/completions \
        -X POST \
        -d '{"model": "Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3", "prompt": "What is Deep Learning?", "max_tokens": 32, "temperature": 0}' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```
    **NOTICE**: First ensure that the model server is operational. Warming up might take a while, and during this phase, the endpoint won't be ready to serve the query.

- Check the `llm-vllm-microservice` status:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:9000/v1/health_check \
        -X GET \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```

- Test the `llm-vllm-microservice` for **non-streaming mode** using the following command:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:9000/v1/chat/completions \
        -X POST \
        -d '{
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "role": "system",
                        "content": "### You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant to help the user with questions. Please refer to the search results obtained from the local knowledge base.

                    },
                    {
                        "role": "user",
                        "content": "### Question: What is Deep Learning? \n\n"
                    }
                ],
                "max_new_tokens":17,
                "top_p":0.95,

                "stream":false
            }' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```

- Test the `llm-vllm-microservice` for **streaming mode** using the following command:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:9000/v1/chat/completions \
        -X POST \
        -d '{
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "role": "system",
                        "content": "### You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant to help the user with questions. Please refer to the search results obtained from the local knowledge base.

                    },
                    {
                        "role": "user",
                        "content": "### Question: What is Deep Learning? \n\n"
                    }
                ],
                "max_new_tokens":32,
                "top_p":0.95,

    ```

### vLLM for Xeon based on Red Hat® Universal Base Image dedicated for OpenShift
This image is based on Universal Base Image 9 (UBI) maintained by Red Hat®.

The image leverages `AMX` and `AVX-512` instruction extensions for improved inference on Sapphire Rapids and newer generations.

It runs vLLM in an unprivileged mode installed on top of UBI9 which makes it a perfect choice for OpenShift deployments on Xeon® as it works out-of-the-box.

The image is publicly available on Intel® AI for Enterprise RAG Docker Hub. It is compatible with all Xeon® CPUs. The image is a different variant of the vLLM image for CPU built and published by the vLLM project, so for deeper insights you can take a look at the [official documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/cpu).

If you want, you can use it as a standalone vLLM in your project.

- Leverages `AMX` and `AVX-512` for optimized inference on SPR+.
  - Falls back to normal instructions on older generations.
- Compatible with any Intel® Xeon® CPUs.
- By default, `VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE` is set to `40GiB`; however, you can change it using an environment variable during runtime.
- Docker Hub -> [docker.io/opea/vllm-cpu-ubi](https://hub.docker.com/r/opea/vllm-cpu-ubi)
- [Dockerfile](./docker/cpu_ubi/Dockerfile)


#### Building the Docker image
You can customize and build the image yourself if needed.
- Default build that uses AMX and AVX-512 on SPR and newer generations, but also works on older generations (falls back to normal instructions when instruction extensions for AMX are not present). Just run `docker build` with default values.
- **TL;DR**
  - Works on any Intel Xeon CPU out-of-the-box. Uses optimizations when present.
```bash
docker build -f cpu_ubi/Dockerfile -t vllm-cpu-ubi:v0.18.0-ubi9 .
```

- More details on build and runtime args in [Build image from source](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/cpu.html#build-image-from-source)

#### Running the Docker container as a standalone server
- Specify `VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE`; it must be lower than your system memory (default is 40GB). A larger KV Cache can support more concurrent requests and longer context lengths.
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE=20 \
  -e HF_TOKEN=<YOUR_HF_TOKEN> \
  docker.io/opea/vllm-cpu-ubi:v0.18.0-ubi9  \
    --model TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8000 \
    --dtype bfloat16
```
